# StarDist ImageJ/Fiji Plugin

This is the ImageJ/Fiji plugin for [StarDist](https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist), which can be used to apply already trained models to new images.

See the [main repository](https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist) for links to our publications and the full-featured Python package that can also be used to train new models.

*Note: The plugin (currently) only supports 2D image and time lapse data.*
